title:'Rock Paper Scissors',
description:`I've developed an interactive rock-paper-scissors game where two players can compete head-to-head. Each round, both players randomly generate either rock, paper, or scissors, and the winner of the round is awarded a point based on classic game rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. If both players choose the same value, the round results in a draw. The game continues until one player reaches 5 points, at which point they are declared the ultimate winner`,
